I travel a fair bit for work and have discovered that when you're living in a hotel it's the simple comforts that you miss the most. Near the top of my list of simple comforts is a good cup of coffee soon after I wake up. The hideous coffee tea-bag things that most hotel rooms provide barely counts as coffee, let alone *good* coffee. A year or so ago I set out to find a way to make good coffee in a hotel room without using up a ton of luggage real-estate. Today I am very happy with my setup, apparently to the point that I'm OK with writing a blog post about it titled "The Ultimate Traveler's Coffee Kit". 

Just to lay my cards on the table, I'm a fan of good coffee but I'm not a serious coffee geek. At home I do have a nice burr grinder but I don't own a goose-neck kettle and I've never used a scale or a stopwatch while brewing coffee. Given that, this travelling setup works great for me.

# The kit

My kit consists of:

- an [Aeropress](http://www.amazon.com/Aeropress-Coffee-and-Espresso-Maker/dp/B0047BIWSK)
- a [Hario Slim](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001804CLY) burr grinder
- a [travel cap](http://www.amazon.com/Able-Brewing-Travel-AeroPress-Espresso/dp/B00E58P8Q4) for the Aeropress
- a [reusable stainless filter](http://www.amazon.com/Filter-AeroPress-Ultra-Stainless-Coffee/dp/B00A1GVVMY) for the Aeropress
- a [camping mug](http://www.rei.com/product/401162/gsi-outdoors-baked-enamelware-cup-12-oz)

Plus a couple of optional extras:

- a cut-down [chamois towel](http://www.amazon.com/Super-Chamois-Large-Absorbant-Cloth/dp/B000ZOT36I)
- some tea bags, for when I don't want coffee

This setup packs almost perfectly into a [small Eagle Creek pack-it bag](http://www.rei.com/product/866239/eagle-creek-original-pack-it-half-tube-cube) that I found at REI. I won't admit to the inappropriate amount of time I spent in the packing-paraphernalia aisle trying out different bags before I settled on that one.

I'm very happy with how compact this whole setup is. It really doesn't take up much room in a suitcase at all.
