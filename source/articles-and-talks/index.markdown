**Feature Toggles**, [on martinfowler.com](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html)

Feature toggles are a powerful technique, allowing teams to modify system behavior without changing code. They fall into various usage categories, and it's important to take that categorization into account when implementing and managing toggles. Toggles introduce complexity. We can keep that complexity in check by using smart toggle implementation practices and appropriate tools to manage our toggle configuration, but we should also aim to constrain the number of toggles in our system.

Any self-respecting dev team should pay attention to automate their processes and conventions with an array of tooling, be it off-the-shelf, customized and fully bespoke. This is where a lot of teams stop, which is a shame. It's great to have the tooling you need, but if you don't organize your workshop so that everything is at hand you're not going to be as effective as you could be. Teams can get a lot more out of their automation by unifying all of their tools and processes under a common interface - the ./go script.
