I am an independent software consultant based in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

Most of my work centers around supporting and advising startup engineering teams.

I enjoy sharing my opinion via [conference talks and writing](/articles-and-talks), often with a focus on agile engineering practices. 

## How I work

I often engage with engineering organizations who are going through some sort of inflection point or experiencing growing pains.

For startups that are just getting off the ground I provide support in hiring an initial engineering team, laying out engineering practices, and defining an architectural approach for the initial MVP.

For startups that have found product/market fit I consult on how to adjust engineering practices and architecture in a post-MVP world where the software being built (and decisions being made!) will likely persist for a lot longer.

I love working with engineering organizations that are starting to move past a single team and/or a single codebase. This is a key inflection point for any engineering org. What has worked well in the previous reality will likely not work well in the future. I provide guidance on how to adjust engineering practices, SDLC and architecture.

I also provide training and mentorship for teams getting started with new technologies or engineering techniques, with a focus on agile engineering practices - things like test automation and continuous delivery.

## My Background

I have been building software and leading teams for about 20 years, working in a wide range of tech stacks and industry verticals. I've worked at startups where I was the first engineer and advised engineering leadership at Fortune 500 companies. 

I am passionate about building pragmatic software and love helping teams learn how to deliver great work at a sustainable pace.
